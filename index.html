    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My Name is <span>Eze Nkiruka Deborah</span>, I am from <span>Udi LGA enugu state</span>. I'm a graduate of <span>Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka</span>.</p>
    <h2>My Experience so far</h2>
    <p>I got admitted into <span>Enugu state tech hub</span> in April to start my classes which will span for four months. In the first four weeks we ran atraining called <span>DUCERP (dIGITAL UPSKILLING CERTIFICATION PROGRAM) </span>where we learnt the basic knowledge of computer although i have been using the computer for quite a while but i learnt a whole lot of things especially during the windows navigation and excel spreadsheet.</p>
    <h2>How it's going</h2>
    <p>currently I'm on the <span>Web development track</span> and we've learnt <span>HTML and CSS</span> which is a product of what I am practicing now. we have a wonderful teacher as well in the person of <span>ADAEZE</span> who has been a very great help in this great learning process and she has been a good teacher and help with great listening ability.</p>
    <h2>What next??</h2>
    <p>I'm of great hope that by the end of this program I will will be able to build standard web pages, as as aaspiring developer i would love to be a problem solver as i already have a couple of ideas, and i hope to acquire the neccessary skills to make these ideas a reality.</p>
